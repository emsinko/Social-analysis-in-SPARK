Ever since his childhood, P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) had dreamed of a better life than the one he was born into. After he loses his job at a shipping company & fears he cannot adequately provide for his loving wife Charity (Michelle Williams) & their two daughters, Barnum conceives the idea to create Barnum’s American Museum, an attraction showcasing various wax models of subjects of interest, including a giraffe, elephant, & various historical figures. Not quite the success he hoped for, Barnum expands his attraction to include human curiosities to serve as performers for his museum. Despite the show initially getting negative reviews & responses from the public, it becomes a huge hit. The show is renamed Barnum’s Circus & in the hopes of furthering his reputation & creating credibility amongst the upper class, Barnum takes on a playwright, Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron), as apprentice & courts famed Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson) to perform in his show leading to even further success. Directed by Michael Gracey from the screenplay by Jenny Bicks & Bill Condon, The Greatest Showman is an enchanting & magical musical that celebrates individuality. The musical numbers were breathtaking & emotional & accompanied by lavish set pieces. The Greatest Showman cast also includes Zendaya as Anne Wheeler, a trapeze artist who Phillip falls for & Keala Settle as Lettie Lutz, the bearded lady. The performances from cast were solid, but it was Keala who stole the film for me. You could feel her pain, especially when she sings the powerful song “This Is Me”. The Greatest Showman is nominated for three Golden Globe Awards: Best Picture-Musical or Comedy, Best Actor (Hugh Jackman) & Best Original Song (This Is Me). Witness the birth of show business by SEEING THIS FILM.</td></tr><tr><td>318530098181576</td><td>No matter what country you live in or culture you belong to, honey is very likely a sweet blessing.

Despite a wonderful time of year for football fans across the EFL, the safety of supporters remains our number one priority.\n\nWhilst not wanting to dampen festive feelgood factor, supporters should be reminded that the threat level for the whole of the UK from terrorism remains at Severe, meaning an attack is highly likely, and sadly we have seen from previous examples that crowded places, such as football stadiums, could potentially be a target.\n\nAs always, we are continuing to work with the police and the relevant authorities to ensure appropriate security arrangements are in place to protect supporters. We therefore encourage fans to enjoy all attended fixtures, but please remain alert and if you see anything that gives you cause for concern, tell a steward or member of staff. In an emergency always call 999. \n\nWhy not arrive in plenty of time and soak up all of the atmosphere on offer, whether that is the pre-match pie or a singalong. At times, a search regime may be in place, so please be mindful that bags and stuffed coat pockets can cause delays. Where appropriate, minimise what you carry into the stadium.\nIn the event of a major incident inside the stadium, it is vital you listen to all official Club announcements and follow all safety instructions, with decisions being made for your safety.\nIn the event of a terrorist incident outside of the stadium, the police advice is to ‘Run, Hide, Tell’. \n\nIt is important to follow this advice and move quickly away from the stadium and to allow access for emergency services. Do not wait around to film anything on your mobile. \n\nRemember, the chance of a terrorist incident is small, but being prepared and ready to respond can help.\n\nMore information can be found at www.gov.uk/ACT. \n\nEnjoy today's game at the LCI Rail Stadium!</td></tr><tr><td>528247103909697</td><td>News organizations are seeing a large increase in subscribers from millennials desperate escape “fake news.”</td></tr><tr><td>351984154864133</td><td>Give your hair, skin and nails a gift they'll really love.

In these dark and troubling times, it's more important than ever to amplify progressive faith voices, and to ground political resistance in spiritual discipline.\n\n\"Each installment of The Resistance Prays includes news of the day, related scripture, interpretation, prayer, and an action item. For example: Are you enraged over President Trump’s recent decision to rescind DACA? Remember that 'There are no deserving or undeserving migrants just as there are no deserving or undeserving children of God.' Then, get involved with the Interfaith Immigration Coalition’s Neighbor to Neighbor meetings...\n\nAs a son of Methodist union organizers, Guthrie says the progressive movement has always been part of his core identity. As a child, he and his parents passed out leaflets to advocate for a higher minimum wage, and in high school, he held a sermon at his church in opposition to the Iraq War. He studied international relations and politics at American University in Washington, D.C., before earning a master's at New York City’s Union Theological Seminary. It was students from that same seminary who invited Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to speak in 1967, which became his historic speech at Riverside Church calling for an end to the Vietnam war.\n\nIn drafting editions of The Resistance Prays, Guthrie says he '[draws] on Union’s long history of public theology, of taking the values of our faith and advocating for them in the public square.'\"\n\nSign up for his newsletter here:\n\n\n---\n\n\nresist faith religion politics Christian trump god progressive justice socialjustice myunion</td></tr><tr><td>206985026082314</td><td>We are thrilled to share pictures of these special boys, our first Hampton Twins blessing Reservations Manager Rosh & his lovely wife, recipients of our special babygro's!

It will go a long way to end the bloodletting, and man’s inhumanity to man, going on the country. \n\nReferendum will be a mare formality, going by the overwhelming success of sit-at-home exercise in Biafran territory recently. It took place on 30th May,  2017. The people there are yearning for emancipation from, internal slavery, and local imperialism, of Hausa/Fulani oligarchy. The clamour has reached irreversible stage.  \n\nBiafrans are among the most oppressed people of the world. They have suffered more than many nations, that eventually become independent from tribal and wicked rulers. There has been systematic repression of Igbos, since the so-called independence in 1960. They are virtually treated as slaves in Nigeria, by mostly northern rulers, who have dominated governance for decades now. \n\nMillions of Igbos have been killed over the years, under the active connivance of most Northern rulers and elites. Their atrocities and subjugation of Igbos, are reminiscent of what Israelis suffered in Egypt; until they were rescued by Almighty God. Our taskmasters have subjected us to all forms of sufferings and deprivations. For instance, no Igbo man has ever ruled Nigeria for the past 51 years. \n\nThey have been banished from occupying virtually all ‘frontline’ positions in the: Presidency, Judiciary, National Assembly, Army, Police, Navy, Air Force, name them, with few exceptions. Nigerian rulers, including military dictators, overlook Igbos in appointments and employments. They want to kill the talents of our people, many of whom are recognized all over the nations for their ingenuity. But, the more they oppress and kill our people, the more they are waxing strong. Igbos have enterprising spirit.\n\nSouth Eastern Nigeria is the least developed in the country. There are many dilapidated, and abandoned federal roads and projects there. There is hardly any federal industry there; no refinery, though an oil producing area. There is no federal steel company there. Nothing! It has the least number of states. Igbos are hated in Nigeria. \n\nThere has been escalation of massacres, burning alive of human beings, since the inception of this disguised Islamic and repressive regime in the year 2015. The battles in Niger Delta left many pipelines, and other oil installations destroyed. It resulted in very low oil output, and subsequent recession in the country.   \n\nThe killing of Igbos by sponsored rioters, Islamic fanatics, Fulani Jihadist Herdsmen, etc, has to come to an end; hence agitation for Biafra. Terrorists, who camouflage as herdsmen, with automatic weapons, are having field day: killing, raping, destroying farmlands, and polluting streams, mostly in the Southern parts of the country, and Middle Belt region, with impunity. Any religious adherents, who regard rape, impregnating of girls and married women, as service to God, are into false religions or secret societies. They are agents of Satan the devil. Nigerian Government and its security agents, have shielded these armed Hausa/Fulani gangs. None of them has ever been charged, and sentenced for those heinous crimes. Instead, the victims have become accused. They are tagged cattle rustlers who should be hunted down. \n\nBoko Haram insurgents, are on rampage. They are the creation of Northern elites. The primary objective was to wrestle power from Christian President Jonathan, and depopulate Christians, especially Igbos. Having achieved their inordinate ambition, it has now backfired on them. They can no longer control the insurgents; who are now also killing their own tribesmen, women and children, in the far North. They felt they have been used and betrayed. End of the conflict is not in sight, with the funding of insurgents by the Government, in the guise of paying ransom. They are all victims of self-inflicted wounds. \n\nLet UN and world leaders come to our rescue, as they did to many countries formerly under enslavement. God Almighty has not forsaken us. He has started to deal with our wicked and callous rulers, both past and present. He has the power to remove anybody from whatever position, whether on temporary or permanent basis, whoever he may be. The LORD reigns in the kingdoms of men. \n\n”Fret not yourself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree. Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace”—Psalm 37: 1,2, 35-37.

Depression-era America goes blissfully about its trick or treating and Halloween parties, or tuning their Philco radios to the Independence Broadcasting Systems to laugh along with, “Clobber McGee & Irish Dave.” But America is startled when a massive alien cylinder slams into the New Jersey countryside, sending the Independence Broadcasting Systems news team scrambling to cover the extraordinary event. Soon cylinders are slamming into cities all over the United States and the world. Inside them are menacing Martian tripods, tall as skyscrapers, and armed with deadly alien technology. The body count rises and the Eastern Seaboard falls before the Martian onslaught, as the world’s combined military might proves not enough to stop the invasion. Humanity itself is threatened with extinction, and a team of earnest news reporters brings Armageddon right into your living room!

Quite often when someone doesn’t feel good, feels ‘off’ in some way, has low energy, gets sick easily, or can’t heal an illness no matter what they try, the underlying cause is stagnation. According to TCM theory, any substance that is in excess or not moving is potentially toxic and injurious. That means that to treat the Five Stagnations is ultimately about clearing toxicity. Because stagnation is so pervasive in our culture, many TCM practitioners first clear toxicity and only then give tonics if necessary.\n\n</td></tr><tr><td>264566099252</td><td>Take the sacred journey with Zaytuna College.

Humor je skrytý a nepovrchní a bez solidních znalostí literární a kritické teorie jej zkrátka nelze pochopit. Dále jsou patrné například prvky postmoderní filosofie a vliv díla Jeana Baudrillarda, zejména L'échange symbolique et la mort. Skuteční fanoušci tohle samozřejmě chápou; jejich intelekt jim umožňuje ocenit hloubku a genialitu tohoto humoru a chápou také, že Špatné Básně nejsou jenom humorné, ale říkají něco podstatného o ŽIVOTĚ. \nZ toho se dá usoudit, že lidé, kteří nemají rádi Špatné básně JSOU idioti – jistě by nepochopili třeba skutečný význam existanciální básně Utírat zadek / není žádná věda/ Ale když se to nepovede / tak běda! \nJedná se samozřejmě o (vpravdě obskurní) odkaz na Turgeněvův epický román Otcové a děti.

Ever since he was 3 he became very attached to his Nuby beaker. If we lost it or left it anywhere then he'd become very distressed and won't drink out of anything else. We had searched high and low for a beaker he couldn't  chew through. He has a habit of chewing things. (Sensory)\"\n\n\"We had come across the Nuby beaker and brought it because it was strong, colourful and met Haydens needs. We brought 2 of these for him.\"\n\n\"Hayden had become very attached to his beaker and it became more of a comfort thing for him.\"\n\n\"Over the year we alternated between 2 breakers but after time they started to wear down due to over use and time. So we looked about for 2 new beakers. We couldn't find them anywhere. We searched online and in all stores but to no avail.\"\n\n\"My husband contacted the Nuby team and liased with Emma. During various email correspondence with Emma, she informed us that she had located similar bottles for Hayden and would send them out, as the beaker Hayden uses was no longer sold in the UK.\"\n\n\"We then received an email stating that the branch in the United States had the same bottle that Hayden loves and would be sending them to the UK branch. Once that had arrived Emma sent them straight over to us.\" \n\n\"Hayden now has x6 new beakers that he loves and we now have a very happy boy.\" \n\n\"I just want to say a massive thank you and show our huge appreciation to Emma and the team at Nuby, who went out of their way to ensure that our boy had his beaker.

This company sold me a faulty phone from the outset which they did not adequately check before sending to me. I have been attempting to resolve myself by dealing between 3 parties: Mobiles, Carphone Warehouse and Samsung to attempt resolution, all to no avail so far.

PG -Dec  23 \nBy Clem The Movie Guy \n\nInspired by a true story  The Greatest Showman is the tale of one man’s dream of creating something spectacular that later became the worldwide sensation known as the Barnum-Bailey Circus  Ever since his childhood  P T  Barnum  Hugh Jackman  had dreamed of a better life than the one he was born into  After he loses his job at a shipping company & fears he cannot adequately provide for his loving wife Charity  Michelle Williams  & their two daughters  Barnum conceives the idea to create Barnum’s American Museum  an attraction showcasing various wax models of subjects of interest  including a giraffe  elephant  & various historical figures  Not quite the success he hoped for  Barnum expands his attraction to include human curiosities to serve as performers for his museum  Despite the show initially getting negative reviews & responses from the public  it becomes a huge hit  The show is renamed Barnum’s Circus & in the hopes of furthering his reputation & creating credibility amongst the upper class  Barnum takes on a playwright  Phillip Carlyle  Zac Efron   as apprentice & courts famed Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind  Rebecca Ferguson  to perform in his show leading to even further success  Directed by Michael Gracey from the screenplay by Jenny Bicks & Bill Condon  The Greatest Showman is an enchanting & magical musical that celebrates individuality  The musical numbers were breathtaking & emotional & accompanied by lavish set pieces  The Greatest Showman cast also includes Zendaya as Anne Wheeler  a trapeze artist who Phillip falls for & Keala Settle as Lettie Lutz  the bearded lady  The performances from cast were solid  but it was Keala who stole the film for me  You could feel her pain  especially when she sings the powerful song “This Is Me”  The Greatest Showman is nominated for three Golden Globe Awards  Best Picture-Musical or Comedy  Best Actor  Hugh Jackman  & Best Original Song  This Is Me   Witness

call 999  \n\nWhy not arrive in plenty of time and soak up all of the atmosphere on offer  whether that is the pre-match pie or a singalong  At times  a search regime may be in place  so please be

 It will go a long way to end the bloodletting  and man’s inhumanity to man  going on the country  \n\nReferendum will be a mare formality  going by the overwhelming success of sit-at-home exercise in Biafran territory recently  It took place on 30th May   2017  The people there are yearning for emancipation from  internal slavery  and local imperialism  of Hausa/Fulani oligarchy  The clamour has reached irreversible stage   \n\nBiafrans are among the most oppressed people of the world  They have suffered more than many nations  that eventually become independent from tribal and wicked rulers  There has been systematic repression of Igbos  since the so-called independence in 1960  They are virtually treated as slaves in Nigeria  by mostly northern rulers  who have dominated governance for decades now  \n\nMillions of Igbos have been killed over the years  under the active connivance of most Northern rulers and elites  Their atrocities and subjugation of Igbos  are reminiscent of what Israelis suffered in Egypt  until they were rescued by Almighty God  Our taskmasters have subjected us to all forms of sufferings and deprivations  For instance  no Igbo man has ever ruled Nigeria for the past 51 years  \n\nThey have been banished from occupying virtually all ‘frontline’ positions in the  Presidency  Judiciary  National Assembly  Army  Police  Navy  Air Force  name them  with few exceptions  Nigerian rulers  including military dictators  overlook Igbos in appointments and employments  They want to kill the talents of our people  many of whom are recognized all over the nations for their ingenuity  But  the more they oppress and kill our people  the more they are waxing strong  Igbos have enterprising spirit \n\nSouth Eastern Nigeria is the least developed in the country  There are many dilapidated  and abandoned federal roads and projects there  There is hardly any federal industry there  no refinery  though an oil producing area  There is no federal steel company there  Nothing  It has the least number of states  Igbos are hated in Nigeria  \n\nThere has been escalation of massacres  burning alive of human beings  since the inception of this disguised Islamic and repressive regime in the year 2015  The battles in Niger Delta left many pipelines  and other oil installations destroyed  It resulted in very low oil output  and subsequent recession in the country    \n\nThe killing of Igbos by sponsored rioters  Islamic fanatics  Fulani Jihadist Herdsmen  etc  has to come to an end  hence agitation for Biafra  Terrorists  who camouflage as herdsmen  with automatic weapons  are having field day  killing  raping  destroying farmlands  and polluting streams  mostly in the Southern parts of the country  and Middle Belt region  with impunity  Any religious adherents  who regard rape  impregnating of girls and married women  as service to God  are into false religions or secret societies  They are agents of Satan the devil  Nigerian Government and its security agents  have shielded these armed Hausa/Fulani gangs  None of them has ever been charged  and sentenced for those heinous crimes  Instead  the victims have become accused  They are tagged cattle rustlers who should be hunted down  \n\nBoko Haram insurgents  are on rampage  They are the creation of Northern elites  The primary objective was to wrestle power from Christian President Jonathan  and depopulate Christians  especially Igbos  Having achieved their inordinate ambition  it has now backfired on them  They can no longer control the insurgents  who are now also killing their own tribesmen  women and children  in the far North  They felt they have been used and betrayed  End of the conflict is not in sight  with the funding of insurgents by the Government  in the guise of paying ransom  They are all victims of self-inflicted wounds  \n\nLet UN and world leaders come to our rescue  as they did to many countries formerly under enslavement  God Almighty has not forsaken us  He has started to deal with our wicked and callous rulers  both past and present  He has the power to remove anybody from whatever position  whether on temporary or permanent basis  whoever he may be  The LORD reigns in the kingdoms of men  \n\n”Fret not yourself because of evildoers  neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity  For they shall soon be cut down like the grass  and wither as the green herb  I have seen the wicked in great power  and spreading himself like a green bay tree  Yet he passed away  and  lo  he was not  yea  I sought him  but he could not be found  Mark the perfect man  and behold the upright  for the end of that man is peace”—Psalm 37  1 2  35-37  Visit   </td><td>List(1, 7, List(), List(0.015120299745908622, 0.9097820494240232,

searched online and in all stores but to no avail \"\n\n\"My husband contacted the Nuby team and liased with Emma  During various email correspondence with Emma  she informed us that she had located similar bottles for Hayden and would send them out  as the beaker Hayden uses was no longer sold in the UK \"\n\n\"We then received an email stating that the branch in the United States had the same bottle that Hayden loves and would be sending them to the UK branch  Once that had arrived Emma sent them straight over to us \" \n\n\"Hayden now has x6 new beakers that he loves and we now have a very happy boy \" \n\n\"I just want to say a massive thank you and show our huge appreciation to Emma and the team at Nuby  who went out of their way to ensure that our boy had his beaker  It took
